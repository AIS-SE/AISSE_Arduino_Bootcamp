# AISSE Ardunio Bootcamp
This is the folder structure and core files for students to participate in the AISSE Ardunio Bootcamp

## Before you begin:
  1. Install [Arduino IDE for Windows & MAC](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)

## Links:
1. [AISSE Arduino Boilerplate](https://github.com/AIS-SE/AISSE_Arduino_Boilerplate) - Including the school sensor, module, shield and electronic component catalogue.

# Bootcamp PipeLine
1. Fork the [AISSE Arduino Bootcamp](https://github.com/AIS-SE/AISSE_Arduino_Bootcamp) to a repo called `2026SE-Arduino-Bootcamp.Ren.Lee` (the year is the year you graduate, and the name is your name)
2. As we work through the Bootcamp, `COMMIT` every successful solution you code out and either a picture of the TINKERCAD or a photo of the Arduino and breadboard
