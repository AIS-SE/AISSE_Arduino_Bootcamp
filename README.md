# TempeHS Ardunio Bootcamp
This is the folder structure and core files for students to participate in the TempeHS Ardunio Bootcamp

## Links:
1. [Design Toolkit](https://tempehs.github.io/designToolKit/)
2. [TempeHS Arduino Boilerplate](https://github.com/TempeHS/TempeHS_Ardunio_Boilerplate) - Including the school sensor, module, shield and electronic component catalogue.

# Bootcamp PipeLine
1. Fork the [TempeHS Arduino Bootcamp](https://github.com/TempeHS/TempeHS_Ardunio_Bootcamp) to a repo called `2024IST-Arduino-Bootcamp.Ben.Jones` (the year is the year you graduate, and the name is your name)
2. As we work through the Bootcamp, `COMMIT` every successful solution you code out and either a picture of the TINKERCAD or a photo of the Arduino and breadboard
